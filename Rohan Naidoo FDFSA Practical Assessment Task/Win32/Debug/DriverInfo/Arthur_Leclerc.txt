Arthur was born in Monaco on 14 October 2000 and will tackle the Formula Regional series this year, having first raced single-seaters in 2018 in the French Formula 4 championship.
In only his second race, he won at Nogaro, going on to repeat that feat later in the year at Magny-Cours. He first came into contact with the FDA last year, when he took part in one of its evaluation Camps, aimed at assessing talented young drivers. He stayed with Formula 4 last year, but moved to the more competitive German ADAC Formel 4, where he performed very consistently. He took one win at Hockenheim, as well as finishing on the podium a further seven times, on his way to a strong fifth in the championship. Leclerc will therefore move up a category, racing for Prema Powerteam.

In 2020 he made his debut with Prema Powerteam in the European Formula Regional championship, catching the eye with some impressive drives in the wet. He was runner-up but took the most wins, six in all, and for 2021 he stays with Prema, moving up to Formula 3.
